Key Tool - Keyboard & Mouse Macro Utility
=========================================

This tool allows you to automate key presses and mouse clicks with customizable intervals, repeat counts, and toggle hotkeys. It's great for games, repetitive tasks, and quality-of-life automation.

----------------------------
How to Use:
----------------------------

1. Open the `key_tool.exe` file.
2. Set your preferred macro keys by clicking "Set Hold Keys" or "Set Press Keys".
3. Configure key and mouse intervals, repeat values, and a hotkey toggle.
4. Press "Start Macro" to begin, or use your chosen hotkey to toggle it on/off.

----------------------------
Troubleshooting:
----------------------------

If the program doesn’t launch or you see errors about missing modules, run the `setup.py` file once.

This will automatically install the required Python packages:
- `keyboard`
- `pynput`

**To run it:**
- Right-click → Open with → Python (if you have Python installed)
- Or open Command Prompt (win+r then type cmd) then paste this: pip install keyboard pynput
Once setup is complete, run `key_tool.exe` again.

Included Files:
----------------------------
- `key_tool.exe`       → The main app
- `key_tool.ico`       → App icon
- `setup.py`           → (Optional) Fixes missing dependency errors
- `README.txt`         → You're reading it :)

----------------------------
Note: If the icon doesn't show up immediately, try moving the `.exe` out of the extracted folder or refresh the folder. Windows is weird sometimes.

Enjoy!
